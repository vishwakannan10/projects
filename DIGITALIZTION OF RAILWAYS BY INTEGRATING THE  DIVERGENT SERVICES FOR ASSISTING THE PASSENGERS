High-speed railway (HSR) brings convenience to peopleâ€™s lives and is generally considered as one of the most sustainable developments for ground transportation. 
We are providing a voice-assisted device on each compartment which helps them to solve train-related queries such as the direction of the station exit, assisting the passenger during medical emergency situation until the doctor arrives, ordering food, helping old aged passengers to find the location of the wheelchair, etc..,
 Safety locker is fixed under each seat of the passenger to ensure the safety of their luggage and to overcome the time delay requested to find stolen luggage on usual procedure.
 This safety locker is also embedded with a voice assistant which helps in enabling it.
